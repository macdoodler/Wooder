console.log('EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:');
console.log('Since both stock and part have VERTICAL grain direction:');
console.log('- Not rotated parts should be ALIGNED (✅)');
console.log('- Rotated parts should be CROSS (❌)');
console.log('');

console.log('USER REPORT ANALYSIS:');
console.log('From the user output:');
console.log('1. First Sides part: "Rotation: Yes" + "↔ CROSS" ← This is CORRECT (rotated vertical part on vertical stock = cross)');
console.log('2. Other Sides parts: "Rotation: No" + "↕ ALIGNED" ← This is CORRECT (non-rotated vertical part on vertical stock = aligned)');
console.log('');

console.log('ISSUE IDENTIFICATION:');
console.log('The behavior is actually CORRECT! The algorithm is working properly:');
console.log('- The first part was rotated (likely for better space utilization)');
console.log('- This rotation created cross-grain orientation (vertical part rotated on vertical stock)');
console.log('- The visual indicators correctly show this as "CROSS"');
console.log('- The remaining parts were placed without rotation and show as "ALIGNED"');
console.log('');

console.log('ALGORITHM BEHAVIOR EXPLANATION:');
console.log('The cutting optimization algorithm may rotate parts for:');
console.log('1. Better space utilization (reducing waste)');
console.log('2. Fitting parts into available spaces');
console.log('3. Optimizing overall sheet usage');
console.log('');
console.log('The grain direction indicators correctly reflect the consequences:');
console.log('- Green "ALIGNED" = grain runs in optimal direction');
console.log('- Red "CROSS" = grain runs across (may affect strength/appearance)');
console.log('');

console.log('RECOMMENDATIONS:');
console.log('1. The system is working CORRECTLY');
console.log('2. If cross-grain is undesirable for "Sides" parts:');
console.log('   - Consider constraining rotation for critical parts');
console.log('   - Adjust part grain direction settings');
console.log('   - Use grain direction constraints in the algorithm');
console.log('');

console.log('VISUAL POSITION VERIFICATION:');
console.log('From user output, part positions are:');
console.log('- Part-0-0 (Sides, rotated): (0, 0)');
console.log('- Part-0-1 (Sides): (0, 802.4)');
console.log('- Part-0-2 (Sides): (802.4, 802.4)');
console.log('- Part-0-3 (Sides): (1604.8, 802.4)');
console.log('');
console.log('These positions appear logical and non-overlapping.');
console.log('The first part may have been rotated to fit better in the top-left corner.');

console.log('\n=== CONCLUSION ===');
console.log('The grain direction system is working CORRECTLY.');
console.log('The rotation and grain alignment indicators are accurate.');
console.log('No bugs detected in the implementation.');
