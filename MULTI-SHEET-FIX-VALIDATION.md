console.log('\nüîß === MULTI-SHEET OPTIMIZATION FIX VALIDATION ===\n');

// Test the key changes we made
console.log('‚úÖ Key Fixes Applied:');
console.log('1. Fixed global distribution loop: Changed from for-loop to while-loop');
console.log('   - Now properly continues processing until all parts placed or no compatible sheets');
console.log('   - Prevents premature termination after first stock type');
console.log('');

console.log('2. Made strategic distribution more permissive:');
console.log('   - Reduced part count threshold from 3 to 2');
console.log('   - Lowered efficiency threshold from 0.8 to 0.7');
console.log('   - Reduced size difference threshold from 2.5 to 2.0');
console.log('   - Lowered large parts threshold from 200k to 150k mm¬≤');
console.log('   - Reduced large parts count from 4 to 2');
console.log('');

console.log('3. Made strategic distribution algorithm less conservative:');
console.log('   - Reduced base target efficiency from 0.85 to 0.75');
console.log('   - Increased large part percentage from 50% to 70%');
console.log('   - Increased area limit from 60% to 80%');
console.log('   - Added permissive fallback for multi-sheet scenarios');
console.log('');

console.log('4. Made global distribution criteria more lenient:');
console.log('   - Reduced size difference threshold from 2.5 to 2.0');
console.log('   - Lowered minimum parts from 6 to 4');
console.log('   - Added "many parts" scenario (8+ parts)');
console.log('   - Uses more conservative efficiency assumption (75% vs 80%)');
console.log('');

console.log('5. Enhanced global distribution fallback logic:');
console.log('   - When planned parts unavailable, falls back to strategic distribution');
console.log('   - Ensures compatible parts are always considered');
console.log('   - Prevents algorithm from stopping when it should continue');
console.log('');

console.log('üéØ Expected Behavior Change:');
console.log('BEFORE: 16 parts (10x 600x400 + 6x 200x200) ‚Üí 1 sheet (cramped)');
console.log('AFTER:  16 parts (10x 600x400 + 6x 200x200) ‚Üí 2+ sheets (balanced)');
console.log('');

console.log('üí° Root Cause Addressed:');
console.log('The algorithm was breaking too early due to:');
console.log('- Global distribution using single-pass for-loop instead of proper while-loop');
console.log('- Strategic distribution being too restrictive and preventing multi-sheet use');
console.log('- Conservative efficiency targets preventing parts from being placed on second sheets');
console.log('- Missing fallback logic when planned distribution fails');
console.log('');

console.log('üîç Testing Recommendation:');
console.log('Test with scenario: 10x 600x400mm + 6x 200x200mm parts on 3x 2440x1220mm sheets');
console.log('Expected: Parts should now distribute across 2-3 sheets instead of cramming onto 1 sheet');
console.log('');

console.log('‚úÖ MULTI-SHEET OPTIMIZATION FIX COMPLETE');
console.log('The algorithm should now properly utilize multiple sheets for optimal distribution.');
