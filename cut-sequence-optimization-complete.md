- **482 lines** of comprehensive cutting sequence logic
- Supports both **sheet materials** and **dimensional lumber**
- Generates step-by-step cutting instructions with priority ordering
- Includes safety scoring, efficiency scoring, and time estimation
- Provides tool suggestions and safety recommendations

### 2. Type System Integration (`/app/lib/types.ts`)
- Added `cutSequences?: OptimizedCutSequence[]` to Results interface
- Proper TypeScript integration with existing type system

### 3. Core Algorithm Integration (`/app/lib/calculateOptimalCuts.ts`)
- Integrated cut sequence generation into main calculation workflow
- Added sequence generation after waste calculation
- Updated all error returns to include `cutSequences: []` for type consistency

### 4. User Interface (`/app/page.tsx`)
- Comprehensive cutting sequence display component
- Step-by-step instructions with numbered sequence
- Color-coded priority system (red=high, yellow=medium, green=low)
- Safety notes with warning icons
- Tool suggestions with appropriate icons
- Safety, efficiency, and time scoring displays
- Recommendations section for best practices

### 5. Testing Infrastructure (`/app/tests/cut-sequence-optimization.test.ts`)
- **5 comprehensive tests** covering all functionality
- ‚úÖ All tests passing
- Covers sheet material and dimensional lumber scenarios
- Verifies safety notes, tool suggestions, and recommendations

## üîß Key Features Implemented

### Cut Sequence Generation
- **Sheet Material Cutting**: 
  - Initial breakdown for large sheets
  - Rip cuts along the grain
  - Crosscuts for final dimensions
  - Trim cuts for precision

- **Dimensional Lumber Cutting**:
  - Consecutive part grouping
  - Optimized cut ordering
  - Waste minimization

### Safety & Efficiency Scoring
- **Safety Score (1-10)**: Based on cut complexity and safety considerations
- **Efficiency Score (1-10)**: Based on cut grouping and material handling
- **Time Estimation**: Realistic time estimates for cutting operations

### User Guidance
- **Safety Notes**: Detailed safety instructions for each cut type
- **Tool Suggestions**: Recommended tools for specific operations
- **Recommendations**: Best practices and tips for optimal results

## üß™ Testing Results

```
‚úÖ All 5 tests passing
