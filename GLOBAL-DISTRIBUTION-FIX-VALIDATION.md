# Global Distribution Fix - Validation Guide

## ✅ STATUS: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

The global distribution fix has been fully implemented and the code compiles without errors. The fix addresses the core issue where parts were being placed in a greedy sequential manner (fill sheet 1 completely, then sheet 2, etc.) instead of planning distribution across all sheets upfront.

## 🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED

### Original Problem
- **Before**: 28 parts on sheet 1 (4 bob parts 800×400mm + 24 keith parts 200×200mm), only 4 keith parts on sheet 2
- **Issue**: Poor space utilization (40.3% across 2 sheets) due to greedy sequential processing

### Solution Implemented
- **Global Distribution Planning**: Plan part distribution across all sheets before processing begins
- **Mixed Size Detection**: Automatically detect when parts have mixed sizes (area ratio > 2.5)
- **Balanced Allocation**: Use round-robin for large parts, balance medium/small parts by sheet load

## 🧪 VALIDATION TEST SCENARIO

### Test Data (Exact Original Problem)
```
Stock: 10 sheets of 2440×1220×18mm Plywood
Parts:
- 4× bob parts (800×400mm) = 1,280,000 mm²
- 24× keith parts (200×200mm) = 960,000 mm²

Total area: 2,240,000 mm²
Sheet area: 2,976,800 mm²
Theoretical efficiency: 75.3%
```

### Expected Behavior
1. **Global Distribution Triggered**: Size ratio 8.0 (800×400 vs 200×200) > 2.5 ✅
2. **Balanced Distribution**: Parts spread across multiple sheets instead of concentrated on sheet 1
3. **Console Logs**: Should show `[GLOBAL-DISTRIBUTION]` messages during optimization

## 🔍 HOW TO TEST

### In the Web Interface (http://localhost:3001)
1. **Add Stock**: 10 sheets of 2440×1220×18mm Plywood
2. **Add Parts**: 
   - Add part: `bob`, 800×400×18mm, quantity 4
   - Add part: `keith`, 200×200×18mm, quantity 24
3. **Run Optimization**: Click "Calculate Optimal Cuts"
4. **Check Results**:
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Look for `[GLOBAL-DISTRIBUTION]` log messages
   - Verify parts are distributed across multiple sheets
   - Check that efficiency is better balanced across sheets

### Expected Console Output
```
[GLOBAL-DISTRIBUTION] Mixed sizes: true, Needs 2 sheets, Has 10 sheets, 28 parts
[GLOBAL-DISTRIBUTION] Should apply global distribution: true
🌍 Applying global distribution planning
[GLOBAL-DISTRIBUTION] Creating global distribution plan across 10 sheets
[GLOBAL-DISTRIBUTION] Distributing 4L + 0M + 24S parts across 2 sheets
[GLOBAL-DISTRIBUTION] Sheet 1: 14 parts (2L+0M+12S), XX.X% planned efficiency
[GLOBAL-DISTRIBUTION] Sheet 2: 14 parts (2L+0M+12S), XX.X% planned efficiency
```

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

### ✅ Global Distribution Activation
- Console shows "Should apply global distribution: true"
- Console shows "🌍 Applying global distribution planning"

### ✅ Better Distribution
- Parts distributed across multiple sheets (not 28+4 pattern)
- More balanced efficiency across sheets
- Better overall space utilization

### ✅ Improved Results
- Total efficiency > 40.3% (original poor result)
- More even part distribution (e.g., 14+14 instead of 28+4)
- Balanced sheet utilization

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Key Changes Made
1. **`shouldApplyGlobalDistribution()`**: Detects when global planning should be used
2. **`createGlobalDistributionPlan()`**: Creates balanced distribution plan across sheets
3. **Modified `optimizeAcrossSheets()`**: Uses global plan instead of greedy sequential processing
4. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed console output for debugging

### Algorithm Architecture
- **Before**: Sequential greedy (fill sheet 1, then sheet 2, etc.)
- **After**: Global planning (plan all sheets, then execute)

### Trigger Conditions
- Mixed part sizes (area ratio > 2.5)
- Multiple sheets needed (estimated > 1)
- Sufficient sheets available
- Enough parts to distribute (≥ 6)

## 📊 TESTING STATUS

- ✅ **Code Implementation**: Complete
- ✅ **Compilation**: No errors
- ✅ **Server Running**: http://localhost:3001
- 🔄 **Manual Validation**: Ready for testing in web interface

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. **Test in Web Interface**: Use the exact scenario above to validate the fix
2. **Verify Console Logs**: Confirm global distribution is being triggered
3. **Check Results**: Ensure better part distribution and efficiency
4. **Performance Test**: Validate that global planning doesn't slow down optimization

The global distribution fix is now ready for validation. The implementation addresses the core architectural issue and should provide significantly better space utilization for mixed-size part scenarios.
